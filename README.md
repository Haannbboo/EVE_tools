## Installations

#### 0. Have a working Python environment. 
#### 1. Download everything under the `/src` folder.
#### 2. Run the `requirements.txt` file under pip install.
```sh
# install after downloading
cd (PATH of the download, change to yours) (e.g. macOS: /Users/{NAME}/Downloads/src; windows: C:\Users\{NAME}\Downloads\src) 

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

If you encounter anything saying pip is not recognized, go back to step 0.
